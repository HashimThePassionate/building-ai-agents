Do you have a preferred time of day for your flights (morning, afternoon, or evening)? <br> 2. Do you have a preferred airline or are you open to all airlines? <br> 3. What class of service would you prefer (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, or First Class)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does the Flight Booking Assistant Work?

The assistant follows a structured workflow involving **planning**, **agent execution**, and **tool calling**. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process based on the conversation and flowchart:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Initiates the Request**

The user starts with a simple request:

> *"Hi, I want to book a flight."*

This request is vague, so the assistant needs more details to proceed. It enters the **Planning Phase** to determine what information is required. üó∫Ô∏è

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Planning Phase: Gathering Information**

The assistant uses a **Planning Agent** to decide what details are needed to look up flights. It identifies:

- Departure and destination cities üåç
- Travel dates üìÖ
- Number of passengers üë•
- Additional preferences (e.g., time of day, class of service) ‚è∞üí∫

#### **Assistant's Response:**

The assistant asks:

> *"Hello! I‚Äôd be happy to help you book a flight. To get started, could you please tell me your departure city and destination?"*

#### **User's Response:**

The user provides:

> *"I want to go from San Diego to SFO."*\
 **"I want to go next Friday and come back on Sunday. Just me traveling."*\
 **"I prefer morning flights. No airline preference. Economy is fine."*

#### **What Happens in the Background?**

- The **Planning Agent** checks: *"Do I have all the info?"*
- Initially, it doesn't, so it keeps asking the user for more details (e.g., travel dates, preferences).
- Once it has enough info, it moves to the next step: **Flight Lookup**. üîç‚úàÔ∏è

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Flight Lookup: Finding Available Flights**

With the user's details (San Diego to SFO, morning flights, economy class, etc.), the assistant uses the **Flight Lookup Agent** to call the **flightLookup_API**. This API searches for available flights matching the criteria.

#### **Assistant's Response:**

The assistant finds and presents options:

> \*"I‚Äôve found a few options for your trip. Here are the best morning flights:\
> Outbound (SAN to SFO) - Next Friday:
>
> 1. United Airlines UA1234: Depart 7:15 AM, Arrive 8:45 AM
> 2. Alaska Airlines AS5678: Depart 8:30 AM, Arrive 10:00 AM\
>    Return (SFO to SAN) - Sunday:
> 3. Delta Air Lines DL9876: Depart 9:00 AM, Arrive 10:30 AM
> 4. Southwest Airlines WN5432: Depart 10:15 AM, Arrive 11:45 AM\
>    The total price for the round trip, including taxes and fees, is:
>
> - Option 1 (United/Alaska): $325
> - Option 2 (Delta/Southwest): $310\
>   Which option would you prefer?"\*

#### **What Happens in the Background?**

- The **Flight Lookup Agent** sends the user's details to the **flightLookup_API**.
- The API returns a list of available flights, which the assistant presents to the user.
- The user selects **Option 2** (Delta/Southwest for $310). ‚úÖ

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Booking Phase: Reserving the Flight**

After the user selects Option 2, the assistant enters another **Planning Phase** to book the flight. It needs additional details to complete the booking, such as:

- Full name üìõ
- Date of birth üéÇ
- Email address üìß
- Phone number üìû
- Special requests (if any) üõ†Ô∏è

#### **Assistant's Response:**

The assistant asks:

> \*"To proceed with the booking, I‚Äôll need some additional information:
>
> 1. Your full name as it appears on your government-issued ID
> 2. Your date of birth
> 3. Your email address (for sending the confirmation)
> 4. Your phone number
> 5. Any special requests (for example, meal preferences, seat preferences)"\*

#### **User's Response:**

The user provides:

> *"Yes, I‚Äôm ready. My name is John Smith, born on 05/15/1985. My email is john.smith@email.com and my phone number is 555-123-4567. No special requests."*

#### **What Happens in the Background?**

- The **Planning Agent** confirms it has all the info: *"Do I have all the info?"* ‚úÖ
- The **Book Flight Agent** calls the **bookFlight_API** with the user's details to reserve the selected flights. ‚úàÔ∏è

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Payment and Confirmation Phase**

The assistant now needs to process the payment and confirm the booking. It cannot accept credit card details directly for security reasons, so it sends a secure payment link to the user's email.

#### **Assistant's Response:**

The assistant says:

> *"The final step is to process the payment of $310 for your flights. For security reasons, I can‚Äôt accept credit card information directly in this chat. Instead, I‚Äôll send a secure payment link to your email address (john.smith@email.com).\
> Once you receive the email, please follow the link to complete the payment process."*

#### **User's Response:**

The user agrees:

> *"Yes, that‚Äôs fine. Please send the payment link."*

#### **What Happens in the Background?**

- The **Planning Agent** identifies the need for a payment link: *"I need to confirm booking, I need email payment link."*
- The **Confirm Flight Agent** calls the **confirmFlight_API** to finalize the booking.
- The **Email Payment Link Agent** calls the **sendEmail_API** to send the payment link to the user's email. üìß
- Once the payment is completed, the system sends a confirmation email with the e-tickets, including:
  - Booking confirmation number üî¢
  - Detailed flight itinerary üó∫Ô∏è
  - Check-in instructions üìã
  - Baggage allowance info üß≥
  - Airline contact info üìû

#### **Final Assistant Response:**

The assistant concludes:

> *"You‚Äôre welcome, Mr. Smith! I‚Äôm glad I could assist you with booking your flights from San Diego to San Francisco. Have a great trip to San Francisco next week!"* üåü

## üìä Flowchart Breakdown (Figure 1.2)

The flowchart (Figure 1.2) visually represents the entire process. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **üîπ Left Side: User Inputs**

- The user's messages are shown on the left, starting with *"Hi, I want to book a flight"* and progressing to providing details like cities, dates, and personal info.
- The assistant responds with *"Request more info"* until it has enough data to proceed.

### **üîπ Center: Planning Phases**

The assistant uses **Planning Agents** to decide what to do at each step:

1. **First Planning Box:**
   - Identifies the need to book a flight.
   - Lists required info: travel cities, dates, number of passengers.
   - Asks: *"Do I have all the info?"* If not, it requests more details from the user.
2. **Second Planning Box:**
   - Identifies the need to reserve the user's selected option (Option 2).
   - Lists required info: name, email, phone, date of birth, special requests.
   - Asks: *"Do I have all the info?"*
3. **Third Planning Box:**
   - Identifies the need to confirm the booking and send a payment link.
   - Asks: *"Do I have all the info?"*

### **üîπ Right Side: Agents and Tools**

Each planning step leads to an **Agent** that calls a specific **Tool** (API):

- **Flight Lookup Agent** ‚Üí **flightLookup_API** (searches for flights).
- **Book Flight Agent** ‚Üí **bookFlight_API** (reserves the flight).
- **Confirm Flight Agent** ‚Üí **confirmFlight_API** (finalizes the booking).
- **Email Payment Link Agent** ‚Üí **sendEmail_API** (sends the payment link).

### **üîπ Top Right: Environment**

The environment represents external systems the assistant interacts with, such as the flight booking APIs and email system. üåê

---

## üß† Key Features of the System

This Flight Booking Assistant showcases several advanced features of LLM-powered agentic systems:

1. **Chain of Thought (CoT):**

   - The assistant "thinks" step-by-step to determine what information is missing and what actions to take. This is shown in the planning phases: *"Do I have all the info?"* ü§î

2. **Multi-Agent Architecture:**

   - The system uses multiple agents (Flight Lookup, Book Flight, Confirm Flight, Email Payment Link) to handle specific tasks. Each agent is specialized and works with a corresponding API. üõ†Ô∏è

3. **Tool Calling:**

   - The assistant interacts with external tools (APIs) to perform real-world actions like searching for flights, booking them, and sending emails. üîß

4. **Interactive and Adaptive:**

   - The assistant adapts to the user's responses. If the user provides incomplete info, it asks for more. If the info is sufficient, it proceeds to the next step. üó£Ô∏è

5. **Human-Like Interaction:**

   - The assistant communicates naturally, summarizing details for the user and ensuring clarity at every step. üåü

---

## üöÄ Why is This System Important?

The Flight Booking Assistant demonstrates the power of **LLM-powered agents** in handling complex, multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional LLMs that only generate text, this system:

- Combines **planning**, **tool use**, and **introspection** to achieve goals.
- Interacts with external systems (APIs) to perform real-world actions.
- Provides a seamless user experience by guiding the user through the process.

This makes it ideal for applications like customer service, travel booking, e-commerce, and more! üåç‚ú®

## üìù Conclusion

The **Flight Booking Assistant** is a perfect example of how LLM-powered multi-agent systems can revolutionize user interactions. By breaking down tasks into manageable steps, using specialized agents, and integrating with external tools, it provides an efficient and user-friendly way to book flights. As AI technology advances, such systems will become even more capable, handling increasingly complex workflows with ease. üöÄ‚úàÔ∏è
